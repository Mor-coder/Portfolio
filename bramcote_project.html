            The Re-vamping of the Bramcote Old Church Tower Trust's website
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-5">
            The Bramcote Old Church Tower Trust is a charity dedicated to the
            preservation of the church Tower, the sole survivor of the original
            12th-century church in Bramcote, Nottingham.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
            I took it upon myself to re-design the charity's website with the
            aim to boost its online traffic and increase visibility. I think
            it's important to know & understand our past to make more conscious
            decisions for a better (present &) future.

          <h3 class="ProjectTitle">The Research Phase</h3>
          <p>
            To familiarise myself with the context of historical and heritage
            sites in the UK, I opted for
            <strong>competitive benchmarking</strong>, researching what other
            trusts or charities were doing to deliver their mission to the
            public.
          </p>
          <p>
            I looked at how they structured their website, what kind of
            informations they provided and where, how they presented their
            events, and how they approached the sticky topic of donations and
            volunteering.

            Once I familiarised myself with such environment, I was keen to gain
            a deeper understanding of how users felt about the Bramcote's
            website. To initiate this I decided to run a series of
            <strong>usability tests</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was interested in knowing what they looked for at glance and,
            mostly, whether there were any discrepancies between what they
            expected to find and what was actually there.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the scenario presented, I told users they were planning a day
            visit to the site and wanted to go on the website to gather useful
            informations beforehand.
          </p>
        </div>
        </div>


        <div class="row mt-3"> 
           <h4 class="WorkSpecs">Results -</h4>
          <div class="col-sm-6">
             <p>
            The results mainly outlined pain points related to either a lack, or
            misplacement, of information. </p>
            <p>Thinking about it, the reason behind these issues was due to a different perception of what was
            important:<strong> while for the Trust's members was important to give more visibility to their events, people needed
            to have access to basic information, before committing to anything activity.</strong> 
          </p>     
          </div>
          
        <div class="col-sm-6"> 
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                The usability test immediately brought up an issue;
                <strong
                  >the lack of immediate access to practical information. </strong
                >When landing on the website users looked for details such as,
                opening hours, directions, and general access availability,
                which were only shown at the bottom of the page. This created
                confusion and a certain degree of frustration.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Secondly, they wanted to know more about the site and its
                history, and ultimately the work undergone by the Trust. At the
                time, the Trust had such information only at the physical site,
                resulting in a
                <strong
                  >lack of information on the history of the tower online.
                </strong>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Last but not least, even though people showed an interest in the
                activities, such as events and volunteering work, offered by the
                Trust, they weren't too keen on actually participating due to
                the lack of information presented online.

<img src="/img/UIexplanation.svg" alt="image showing Mosaiq Project Page UI with each element explained" class="img-fluid UIexplanation">
<p><strong>MosaiQ Labs is a startup with the mission to integrate AI solutions to knowledge workers workflows.</strong> Data collection reported that users followed a specific research model that can be broken down into three section:<strong> data collection, data analysis, and production of deliverables. The Project Page is where all these three come together. </strong></p>
<p>The Project Page is where all the saved files are collected, and where they can be accessed for analysis with the support of the AI. It is divided in two main sections: the files’ database on the left, and the AI assistant on the right.<strong> The Assistant has many functions and can interact with the database in various ways:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            It can interact with the whole content of the database or selected articles
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            It stores AI Modules. These can be called directly from the assistant to interact with the database or selected articles
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            It stores Templates. As the name suggests, templates are the structure of the final deliverable. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            It stored the chat history 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            It allows user to Export or Download the entire chat or a selected segment of the chat
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            It nests the Assistant Mode. The Assistant Mode lets users choose between answers based on key excerpts or full-text analysis
        </p>
    </li>
</ul> 
<p>
    Because researching is ultimately an iterative process with many back and forth,<strong> the goal was to create a flexible environment, in which all  components could interact between them as well as being used separately.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, the design of each component presented its own challenges. Here’s an overview on how we overcome them.

        <p><strong>What if users need to work with multiple file types?</strong></p>
        <p> <i class="bi bi-1-square"></i> In 2022, Beta testing showed that users primarily relied on web articles and PDFs for their work. This insight, led us to limit the supported file types and design a streamlined UI focused on simplifying file search. </p>
        <p>As the Beta user base expanded, however, new needs emerged — particularly the ability to work with additional file types such as tables and charts. Our challenge was to integrate these formats while maintaining, and ideally enhancing, the efficiency of the search experience.</p>

        <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
        <p>The file types are divided into sections and users can only scroll down to find the article, making the action quite time consuming when working with a big database. </p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong></p>   
        <p>How do we add more file types while improving the search for files?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>To solve this issues, we looked at two separate features that collectively would provide an efficient answer to the problems. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>We decided to have just <strong>one file list</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Inspired by the Mac file manager or “Finder” we opted to add columns</strong> at the top of the list to help organise the list either by: (File) Name, Type, Source, Date Added, and Actions.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                   <strong>We add Filters</strong> above the list providing the option to choose to view the full list or just a list of the required file types.

        <p><strong>What if files could be selected? Which visual cues should we incorporate to make a solid connection? </strong></p>
        <p> <i class="bi bi-2-square"></i> In 2022, Beta testing showed that users primarily relied on web articles and PDFs for their work. This insight, led us to limit the supported file types and design a streamlined UI focused on simplifying file search. </p>

        <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
        <p>Users want to select one, or more files, to interact with the assistant. They don’t want the assistant to analyse the whole project content. </p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong></p>   
        <p>How do we visualise the assistant’s interaction with the selected files?   </p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>To solve this issues we implemented two features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Inspired by the well know <strong>Gmail</strong>, we added check-boxes to select the files of interest. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                   <strong>On top of the checked check box, we added a different colour background for the selected files</strong> to strengthen the difference between the selected and unselected articles. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    We added a visual cue in the assistant <strong>“Reply to”</strong> to show with what is the AI interacting to. For the single item it would show the article’s title while for more than one item it shows <strong>“Reply to | n of files selected”</strong> 
                </p>
            </li>

        <p>Unless instructed otherwise, the machine extrapolates, analyses, and combines data from all the sources nested in the project, to provide a comprehensive answer. But how can users know from where exactly has the machine taken the information from?</p>
        <p>While seeing a the source of a citation has always been possible, it didn’t seem to be a predominant feature at the beginning, hence it had a relatively small space relegated to it.</p>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong></p>   
        <p>How do users understand from where has the machine extrapolated the information from? </p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

            <li>
                <p>
                   <strong>We enlarged the citation “bubble”</strong> and juxtapose it over the assistant’s answer.<strong>On top of it, we added a shadow effect</strong> to make the bubble stand out from the text behind. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    We also taught about <strong>darkening the screen underneath to accentuate the difference even more. </strong>

                <p>
                    If not enough, and the user wanted to see the snippet of text in source, we’ve added a tab on the right lower corner of the bubble with a tab <strong>“View in source”.</strong> When clicked, it opens the citation’s original source file in the Viewer on the left side of the screen.

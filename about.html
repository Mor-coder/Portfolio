        <h2 class="subtitle">Hi there, I'm a ux/ui designer with a keen interest in the human-machine relationship and a yoga teacher.</h2>
    <p class="mt-5">I have worked extensively on the integration of AI into workflows, specifically within the finance industry.</p>
    <p>And I hold space for people to come and practice in a safe, friendly, and inclusive environment.</p>
    <p>Funny enough, both processes - that is learning how to use digital technologies, and learning how to move in a yoga class - can equally be pretty daunting experiences, and it's my job, as the facilitator, to create an environment in which everyone feels free & safe to move in the space.

            <h4 class="subtitle">Building empathy —</h4>
            <p>
              Both yoga and technology often carry a similar stigma: they can appear unreachable, too complex, or something you must already be “good at” before you begin.  
              In both roles—designer and yoga practitioner—I see my job as helping people feel that there is no single correct way to move, learn, or explore.  
              My goal is to shift perceptions and help people trust their intuition, instead of feeling judged by rules or expectations.
            </p> 
          </li>
      
          <li>
            <h4 class="subtitle">Approaching disabilities —</h4>
            <p>
              Yoga relies heavily on physical ability, so when an injury happens (and they happen more often than I expected!), even small limitations change how I perceive the world. Suddenly actions that once felt effortless require awareness, adaptation, and patience.
            </p>
            <p>
              While this can feel discouraging at first, it also creates empathy. It pushes me to consider the lived experiences of people with temporary, situational, or permanent disabilities—and how design can meaningfully support them.
            </p>
            <p>
              On a personal level, my sister lives with a permanent hearing disability. Growing up alongside her and watching her navigate the world in ways that work best for her deeply shaped my desire to design experiences that include, adapt, and empower.
            </p>

            <h4 class="subtitle">Appreciating diversity —</h4>
            <p>
              I'm still not sure whether the belief that <strong>there is no right or wrong way of doing things</strong> came from yoga, UX, or coding.  
              Most likely, all three reinforced the same lesson: people move, think, and learn differently, and good systems should make space for that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Embracing this plurality brings a sense of lightness. It encourages creativity, experimentation, and forward-thinking.  
              It reduces friction between “how things should be done” and “how they can be done,” relieving pressure and fostering both intellectual and physical openness.

        To conclude, I’d like to share one of my favourite quotes from Margaret Mead.  
        It continues to shape the way I observe, understand, and appreciate both people and UX —
      </p>
           <h2 class="quote mt-3">
        "What people say, what people do, and what they say they do are entirely different things."
